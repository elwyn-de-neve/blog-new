                <h2>Amsterdam truly is one of the most wonderful cities in the world. We made you a complete guide to
                    Amsterdam as a first-timer.</h2>
                <p>Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands – a huge city with more than one million inhabitants,
                    filled with incredible architecture, museums, food and culture. It is often referred to as the
                    Venice of the North, because of the many canals that criss-cross the city and the 1,281 bridges that
                    can be found along those canals.</p>
                <p>If you’re thinking about a trip to Amsterdam, check out our essential travel guide to Amsterdam for
                    the best hotels, neighborhoods, things to do, and places to eat and drink in Amsterdam, The
                    Netherlands.</p>
                <blockquote>Amsterdam was a great surprise to me. I had always thought of Venice as the city of canals;
                    it had never entered my mind that I should find similar conditions in a Dutch town.
                </blockquote>
                <p>Whether you prefer culture and history, poking around in museums, doing some serious partying, or
                    just enjoying the relaxing charm of an old European city, there are many distinct neighborhoods (or
                    districts) to explore within Amsterdam.</p>

                <h2>When to Go to Amsterdam</h2>
                <p>Any time of the year is good to travel to Amsterdam, although it is advisable to bring rain gear
                    because it can rain at anytime. July to August is considered peak seasons for travel. So you can
                    find the best rates for hotels and flights outside those times. To avoid crazy crowds while still
                    enjoying good weather, we recommend visiting Amsterdam in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>April</li>
                    <li>May</li>
                    <li>September</li>
                    <li>October</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As far as weather, it never really gets too hot or too cold in Amsterdam. Clouds and some rain are
                    really the extent of the weather patterns.</p>

                <h2>What to do in Amsterdam</h2>
                <p>Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe.
                    With its universities, academies, and research institutes, along with more than 40 museums, numerous
                    theaters, and entertainment venues, Amsterdam is also the country's leading cultural center.</p>
                <p>In addition, the city is famous for its many well-preserved historic homes. Laid out in a pattern of
                    concentric segments in the shape of a fan, these well-preserved heritage buildings are built on
                    piles driven through an upper layer of mud into the firm, sandy bottom up to 18 meters below.</p>
